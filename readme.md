# Damage Detection Using Autoencoder (AE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for nonlinear systems

This repository contains the code implementation for **Deep learning architectures for data-driven damage
detection in nonlinear dynamic systems under random vibrations** based on the methods described in the journal paper.


## Introduction
Structural damage detection is a critical task in engineering. This project uses deep learning techniques (AE and GAN) to detect damage in nonlinear systems  by analyzing time-series data based on 1D CNN. These NNs are trained in an unsupervised manner and their performances are compared for different nonlinear systems. The time-series data for the nonlinear system are generated using numerical computations. The following nonlinear systems are considered 
- 1-DOF Duffing system
- 2-DOF Duffing system
- Vibration isolator with super elastic hysteresis and negative stiffness
The damage time-series dataset for these systems were obtained by systematically reducing the stiffness of the system. Finally the AE, GAN architectures were tested on a experimental dataset of a Magneto-elastic clamped beam system.

Key contributions of the paper:
- AE for feature extraction and damage detection.
- Discriminator- part of GAN for detecting damaged time series signals.
